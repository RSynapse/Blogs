# How to Use ChatGPT with Narrative Bullet Tool

If you want to get the same results you are used to seeing within Narrative Buddy, inside of ChatGPT follow these steps:

1. **Copy the primer text** - The first thing you need to do is copy the primer text.  This is the exact text I use to prime every API call that is made through Narrative Buddy.  Copy the following text inside of the quotes:

"Narrative Statements are a narrative style used to communicate accomplishments and results in the United States Air Force. They should be efficient and increase clarity of an Airman's performance.

In the United States Air Force, Narrative Statements should be a standalone sentence with action and at least one of impact or results/outcome and written in plain language without uncommon acronyms and abbreviations.

The first word of a narrative statement should be a strong action verb.

The performance statement should be one sentence and written in past tense. It should also include transition words like "by" and "which".

Personal pronouns (I, me, my, we, us, our, etc.) should not be used.

If I give you some input could you write me a narrative statement with those rules in mind?"
